# Finding-Anagrams-Using-Recursion

## Description
An anagram is a permutation of the letters of a word that produces another word. Your task for this lab
consists of writing a program that asks a user to input a word and then prints all the anagrams of that word.
Download from the class webpage the le words alpha.txt, which contains over 466000 words in the English
language. Your program should read the words in the le and, as the words are read, they should be stored in
a set (see section 13.24 in the online textbook). Your program should then use a recursive function, similar to
the ones seen in class and described in the textbook, to nd the anagrams. The anagrams should be displayed
in alphabetical order and contain no duplicates. Your program should also display the time it took to nd the
anagrams.

This a possible run of your program:
Enter a word or empty string to finish: poster
The word poster has the following 6 anagrams:
presto
repost
respot
stoper
topers
tropes
It took 0.000000 seconds to find the anagrams

Enter a word or empty string to finish: university
The word university has the following 0 anagrams:
It took 12.506083 seconds to find the anagrams

Enter a word or empty string to finish: permutation
The word permutation has the following 1 anagrams:
importunate
It took 138.054811 seconds to find the anagrams

Enter a word or empty string to finish:
Bye, thanks for using this program!
